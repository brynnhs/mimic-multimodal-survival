====================================
Project: Multimodal Survival Prediction (MIMIC-IV + CXR Embeddings)
Team: Brynn Harris-Shanks, Julian Ostermaier
====================================

BRYNN - CODING, MODELING, MAIN RESULTS

[ ] B1 - Set up repo structure, environment, and shared config files
[ ] B2 - Implement clinical feature preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
[ ] B3 - Define survival outcome and censoring logic in code
[ ] B4 - Implement clinical-only baseline survival models (Cox, RSF, simple DeepSurv)
[ ] B5 - Implement evaluation utilities (C-index, IBS, calibration, KM curves)
[ ] B6 - Design and implement multimodal fusion strategies (early / late / intermediate)
[ ] B7 - Run main multimodal model experiments and save metrics
[ ] B8 - Generate core figures for report (performance plots, KM curves, calibration plots)
[ ] B9 - Draft Methods subsections for models and evaluation
[ ] B10 - Draft Results subsections for primary model comparison (clinical vs image vs fusion)
[ ] B11 - Create slides for methods, models, and main results for the Jan 6 presentation

JULIAN - DATA PIPELINE, EMBEDDINGS, SECONDARY ANALYSES

[ ] J1 - Confirm data access and directory structure for MIMIC-IV and CXR embeddings
[ ] J2 - Implement cohort definition (inclusion/exclusion, time windows, linkage rules)
[ ] J3 - Implement image embedding preprocessing (filtering, normalization, handling multiple images)
[ ] J4 - Apply dimensionality reduction on embeddings (e.g., PCA) and document selected approach
[ ] J5 - Implement image-only survival models using embeddings (Cox / DeepSurv)
[ ] J6 - Assist with hyperparameter tuning and configuration for fusion models
[ ] J7 - Create descriptive statistics tables (cohort stats, variable distributions, missingness)
[ ] J8 - Run and document secondary analyses (e.g., ablations on fusion strategies, sensitivity checks)
[ ] J9 - Draft Methods subsections for data, cohort, preprocessing, and embeddings
[ ] J10 - Draft Results subsections for descriptive statistics and secondary analyses
[ ] J11 - Create slides for background, data, cohorts, fusion strategies at a high level, and conclusions
